# Overview
This is a simulation based on the rules defined in Conway's Game of life

## Live Demo
The live demo of this is available over [here](https://conway-game-of-life-ashun.vercel.app/)

## Rules in Conway's game of life
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
* Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
* All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

## How to Run

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. A webpage will show in the browser. Click the board to set up the initial state, or use the "Random" button to randomize the board.
